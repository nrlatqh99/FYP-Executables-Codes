# Information Retrieval on Hadith Content using Pattern Matching 

Search engine technology has been utilized to swiftly and effectively locate information retrieval (IR) as required, especially in finding information about the Hadith which was the second guideline for Muslims in addition to the Holy Quran. In this research, pattern matching is arranged using approaches such as natural language processing (NLP) and text similarity metrics to recognize patterns from words. Both of these approaches exhibit latent semantic analysis (LSA) and cosine similarity algorithms to enhance the representation of documents and queries. To isolate the algorithm and generate a vector representation of a document in the LSA steps, the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) solution is used by computing the distances between vectors.

This study compared and evaluated several different classifier algorithm models including Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Naive Bayes (NB), and FastText that perform within Hadith of Sahih Bukhari content. According to the results of tests done on 20 documents (chapters) of Hadith, the FastText are the classifiers with the highest similarity accuracy of 99%. Meanwhile, SVM achieved 69% precision and 58% recall, whereas KNN achieved 64% and 52% precision and recall, respectively. The models that obtained low precision and recall were NB of only 54% and 36%, respectively.
