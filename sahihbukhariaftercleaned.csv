2,2,3, Sahih Bukhari ,1,3,Revelation," Narrated 'Aisha:                       (the mother of the faithful believers) The commencement of the Divine Inspiration to Allah's Apostle was in the form of good dreams which came true like bright daylight, and then the love of seclusion was bestowed upon him. He used to go in seclusion in the cave of Hira where he used to worship (Allah alone) continuously for many days before his desire to see his family. He used to take with him the journey food for the stay and then come back to (his wife) Khadija to take his food likewise again till suddenly the Truth descended upon him while he was in the cave of Hira. The angel came to him and asked him to read. The Prophet replied, ""I do not know how to read."" The Prophet added, ""The angel caught me (forcefully) and pressed me so hard that I could not bear it any more. He then released me and again asked me to read and I replied, 'I do not know how to read.' Thereupon he caught me again and pressed me a second time till I could not bear it any more. He then released me and again asked me to read but again I replied, 'I do not know how to read (or what shall I read)?' Thereupon he caught me for the third time and pressed me, and then released me and said, 'Read in the name of your Lord, who has created (all that exists), created man from a clot. Read! And your Lord is the Most Generous."" (96.1, 96.2, 96.3) Then Allah's Apostle returned with the Inspiration and with his heart beating severely. Then he went to Khadija bint Khuwailid and said, ""Cover me! Cover me!"" They covered him till his fear was over and after that he told her everything that had happened and said, ""I fear that something may happen to me."" Khadija replied, ""Never! By Allah, Allah will never disgrace you. You keep good relations with your kith and kin, help the poor and the destitute, serve your guests generously and assist the deserving calamity-afflicted ones.""  Khadija then accompanied him to her cousin Waraqa bin Naufal bin Asad bin 'Abdul 'Uzza, who, during the pre-Islamic Period became a Christian and used to write the writing with Hebrew letters. He would write from the Gospel in Hebrew as much as Allah wished him to write. He was an old man and had lost his eyesight. Khadija said to Waraqa, ""Listen to the story of your nephew, O my cousin!"" Waraqa asked, ""O my nephew! What have you seen?"" Allah's Apostle described whatever he had seen. Waraqa said, ""This is the same one who keeps the secrets (angel Gabriel) whom Allah had sent to Moses. I wish I were young and could live up to the time when your people would turn you out."" Allah's Apostle asked, ""Will they drive me out?"" Waraqa replied in the affirmative and said, ""Anyone (man) who came with something similar to what you have brought was treated with hostility; and if I should remain alive till the day when you will be turned out then I would support you strongly."" But after a few days Waraqa died and the Divine Inspiration was also paused for a while.","['narrated', ""'aisha"", ':', '(', 'the', 'mother', 'of', 'the', 'faithful', 'believers', ')', 'the',

6,6,7, Sahih Bukhari ,1,7,Revelation,"      Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Abbas:                          Abu Sufyan bin Harb informed me that Heraclius had sent a messenger to     him while he had been accompanying a caravan from Quraish. They were      merchants doing business in Sham (Syria, Palestine, Lebanon and      Jordan), at the time when Allah's Apostle had truce with Abu Sufyan      and Quraish infidels. So Abu Sufyan and his companions went to      Heraclius at Ilya (Jerusalem). Heraclius called them in the court and      he had all the senior Roman dignitaries around him. He called for his      translator who, translating Heraclius's question said to them, ""Who      amongst you is closely related to that man who claims to be a      Prophet?"" Abu Sufyan replied, ""I am the nearest relative to him      (amongst the group).""     Heraclius said, ""Bring him (Abu Sufyan) close to me and make his      companions stand behind him."" Abu Sufyan added, Heraclius told his      translator to tell my companions that he wanted to put some questions      to me regarding that man (The Prophet) and that if I told a lie they      (my companions) should contradict me."" Abu Sufyan added, ""By Allah!      Had I not been afraid of my companions labeling me a liar, I would not     have spoken the truth about the Prophet. The first question he asked      me about him was:     'What is his family status amongst you?'      I replied, 'He belongs to a good (noble) family amongst us.'      Heraclius further asked, 'Has anybody amongst you ever claimed the      same (i.e. to be a Prophet) before him?'     I replied, 'No.'     He said, 'Was anybody amongst his ancestors a king?'     I replied, 'No.'     Heraclius asked, 'Do the nobles or the poor follow him?'     I replied, 'It is the poor who follow him.'     He said, 'Are his followers increasing decreasing (day by day)?'     I replied, 'They are increasing.'     He then asked, 'Does anybody amongst those who embrace his religion      become displeased and renounce the religion afterwards?'     I replied, 'No.'     Heraclius said, 'Have you ever accused him of telling lies before his      claim (to be a Prophet)?'     I replied, 'No. '     Heraclius said, 'Does he break his promises?'     I replied, 'No. We are at truce with him but we do not know what he      will do in it.' I could not find opportunity to say anything against      him except that.     Heraclius asked, 'Have you ever had a war with him?'     I replied, 'Yes.'     Then he said, 'What was the outcome of the battles?'     I replied, 'Sometimes he was victorious and sometimes we.'     Heraclius said, 'What does he order you to do?'     I said, 'He tells us to worship Allah and Allah alone and not to      worship anything along with Him, and to renounce all that our      ancestors had said. He orders us to pray, to speak the truth, to be      chaste and to keep good relations with our Kith and kin.'     Heraclius asked the translator to convey to me the following, I asked      you about his family and your reply was that he belonged to a very      noble family. In fact all the Apostles come from noble families      amongst their respective peoples. I questioned you whether anybody      else amongst you claimed such a thing, your reply was in the negative.     If the answer had been in the affirmative, I would have thought that      this man was following the previous man's statement. Then I asked you      whether anyone of his ancestors was a king. Your reply was in the      negative, and if it had been in the affirmative, I would have thought      that this man wanted to take back his ancestral kingdom.     I further asked whether he was ever accused of telling lies before he      said what he said, and your reply was in the negative. So I wondered      how a person who does not tell a lie about others could ever tell a      lie about Allah. I, then asked you whether the rich people followed      him or the poor. You replied that it was the poor who followed him.      And in fact all the Apostle have been followed by this very class of      people. Then I asked you whether his followers were increasing or      decreasing. You replied that they were increasing, and in fact this is     the way of true faith, till it is complete in all respects. I further      asked you whether there was anybody, who, after embracing his      religion, became displeased and discarded his religion. Your reply was     in the negative, and in fact this is (the sign of) true faith, when      its delight enters the hearts and mixes with them completely. I asked      you whether he had ever betrayed. You replied in the negative and      likewise the Apostles never betray. Then I asked you what he ordered      you to do. You replied that he ordered you to worship Allah and Allah      alone and not to worship any thing along with Him and forbade you to      worship idols and ordered you to pray, to speak the truth and to be      chaste. If what you have said is true, he will very soon occupy this      place underneath my feet and I knew it (from the scriptures) that he      was going to appear but I did not know that he would be from you, and      if I could reach him definitely, I would go immediately to meet him      and if I were with him, I would certainly wash his feet.' Heraclius      then asked for the letter addressed by Allah's Apostle     which was delivered by Dihya to the Governor of Busra, who forwarded      it to Heraclius to read. The contents of the letter were as follows:      ""In the name of Allah the Beneficent, the Merciful (This letter is)      from Muhammad the slave of Allah and His Apostle to Heraclius the      ruler of Byzantine. Peace be upon him, who follows the right path.      Furthermore I invite you to Islam, and if you become a Muslim you will     be safe, and Allah will double your reward, and if you reject this      invitation of Islam you will be committing a sin by misguiding your      Arisiyin (peasants). (And I recite to you Allah's Statement:)     'O people of the scripture! Come to a word common to you and us that      we worship none but Allah and that we associate nothing in worship      with Him, and that none of us shall take others as Lords beside Allah.     Then, if they turn away, say: Bear witness that we are Muslims (those      who have surrendered to Allah).' (3:64).     Abu Sufyan then added, ""When Heraclius had finished his speech and had     read the letter, there was a great hue and cry in the Royal Court. So      we were turned out of the court. I told my companions that the      question of Ibn-Abi-Kabsha) (the Prophet Muhammad) has become so      prominent that even the King of Bani Al-Asfar (Byzantine) is afraid of     him. Then I started to become sure that he (the Prophet) would be the      conqueror in the near future till I embraced Islam (i.e. Allah guided      me to it).""     The sub narrator adds, ""Ibn An-Natur was the Governor of llya'      (Jerusalem) and Heraclius was the head of the Christians of Sham. Ibn      An-Natur narrates that once while Heraclius was visiting ilya'      (Jerusalem), he got up in the morning with a sad mood. Some of his      priests asked him why he was in that mood? Heraclius was a foreteller      and an astrologer. He replied, 'At night when I looked at the stars, I     saw that the leader of those who practice circumcision had appeared      (become the conqueror). Who are they who practice circumcision?' The      people replied, 'Except the Jews nobody practices circumcision, so you     should not be afraid of them (Jews).     'Just Issue orders to kill every Jew present in the country.'     While they were discussing it, a messenger sent by the king of Ghassan     to convey the news of Allah's Apostle to Heraclius was brought in.      Having heard the news, he (Heraclius) ordered the people to go and see     whether the messenger of Ghassan was circumcised. The people, after      seeing him, told Heraclius that he was circumcised. Heraclius then      asked him about the Arabs. The messenger replied, 'Arabs also practice     circumcision.'     (After hearing that) Heraclius remarked that sovereignty of the 'Arabs     had appeared. Heraclius then wrote a letter to his friend in Rome who      was as good as Heraclius in knowledge. Heraclius then left for Homs.      (a town in Syrian and stayed there till he received the reply of his      letter from his friend who agreed with him in his opinion about the      emergence of the Prophet and the fact that he was a Prophet. On that      Heraclius invited all the heads of the Byzantines to assemble in his      palace at Homs. When they assembled, he ordered that all the doors of      his palace be closed. Then he came out and said, 'O Byzantines! If      success is your desire and if you seek right guidance and want your      empire to remain then give a pledge of allegiance to this Prophet      (i.e. embrace Islam).'     (On hearing the views of Heraclius) the people ran towards the gates      of the palace like onagers but found the doors closed. Heraclius      realized their hatred towards Islam and when he lost the hope of their     embracing Islam, he ordered that they should be brought back in      audience.     (When they returned) he said, 'What already said was just to test the      strength of your conviction and I have seen it.' The people prostrated     before him and became pleased with him, and this was the end of      Heraclius's story (in connection with his faith).","['narrated', ""'abdullah"", 'bin', ""'abbas"", ':',

accompanying a caravan from quraish  they were merchants doing business in sham  syria  palestine  lebanon and jordan   at the time when allah s apostle had truce with abu sufyan and quraish infidels  so abu sufyan and his companions went to heraclius at ilya  jerusalem   heraclius called them in the court and he had all the senior roman dignitaries around him  he called for his translator who  translating heraclius s question said to them   who amongst you is closely related to that man who claims to be a prophet   abu sufyan replied   i am the nearest relative to him  amongst the group    heraclius said   bring him  abu sufyan  close to me and make his companions stand behind him   abu sufyan added  heraclius told his translator to tell my companions that he wanted to put some questions to me regarding that man  the prophet  and that if i told a lie they  my companions  should contradict me   abu sufyan added   by allah  had i not been afraid of my companions labeling me a liar  i would not have spoken the truth about the prophet  the first question he asked me about him was  what is his family status amongst you   i replied  he belongs to a good  noble  family amongst us   heraclius further asked  has anybody amongst you ever claimed the same  ie  to be a prophet  before him   i replied  no   he said  was anybody amongst his ancestors a king   i replied  no   heraclius asked  do the nobles or the poor follow him   i replied  it is the poor who follow him   he said  are his followers increasing decreasing  day by day    i replied  they are increasing   he then asked  does anybody amongst those who embrace his religion become displeased and renounce the religion afterwards   i replied  no   heraclius said  have you ever accused him of telling lies before his claim  to be a prophet    i replied  no   heraclius said  does he break his promises   i replied  no  we are at truce with him but we do not know what he will do in it   i could not find opportunity to say anything against him except that  heraclius asked  have you ever had a war with him   i replied  yes   then he said  what was the outcome of the battles   i replied  sometimes he was victorious and sometimes we   heraclius said  what does he order you to do   i said  he tells us to worship allah and allah alone and not to worship anything along with him  and to renounce all that our ancestors had said  he orders us to pray  to speak the truth  to be chaste and to keep good relations with our kith and kin   heraclius asked the translator to convey to me the following  i asked you about his family and your reply was that he belonged to a very noble family  in fact all the apostles come from noble families amongst their respective peoples  i questioned you whether anybody else amongst you claimed such a thing  your reply was in the negative  if the answer had been in the affirmative  i would have thought that this man was following the previous man s statement  then i asked you whether anyone of his ancestors was a king  your reply was in the negative  and if it had been in the affirmative  i would have thought that this man wanted to take back his ancestral kingdom  i further asked whether he was ever accused of telling lies before he said what he said  and your reply was in the negative  so i wondered how a person who does not tell a lie about others could ever tell a lie about allah  i  then asked you whether the rich people followed him or the poor  you replied that it was the poor who followed him  and in fact all the apostle have been followed by this very class of people  then i asked you whether his followers were increasing or decreasing  you replied that they were increasing  and in fact this is the way of true faith  till it is complete in all respects  i further asked you whether there was anybody  who  after embracing his religion  became displeased and discarded his religion  your reply was in the negative  and in fact this is  the sign of  true faith  when its delight enters the hearts and mixes with them completely  i asked you whether he had ever betrayed  you replied in the negative and likewise the apostles never betray  then i asked you what he ordered you to do  you replied that he ordered you to worship allah and allah alone and not to worship any thing along with him and forbade you to worship idols and ordered you to pray  to speak the truth and to be chaste  if what you have said is true  he will very soon occupy this place underneath my feet and i knew it  from the scriptures  that he was going to appear but i did not know that he would be from you  and if i could reach him definitely  i would go immediately to meet him and if i were with him  i would certainly wash his feet   heraclius then asked for the letter addressed by allah s apostle which was delivered by dihya to the governor of busra  who forwarded it to heraclius to read  the contents of the letter were as follows   in the name of allah the beneficent  the merciful  this letter is  from muhammad the slave of allah and his apostle to heraclius the ruler of byzantine  peace be upon him  who follows the right path  furthermore i invite you to islam  and if you become a muslim you will be safe  and allah will double your reward  and if you reject this invitation of islam you will be committing a sin by misguiding your arisiyin  peasants    and i recite to you allah s statement    o people of the scripture  come to a word common to you and us that we worship none but allah and that we associate nothing in worship with him  and that none of us shall take others as lords beside allah  then  if they turn away  say  bear witness that we are muslims  those who have surrendered to allah     364   abu sufyan then added   when heraclius had finished his speech and had read the letter  there was a great hue and cry in the royal court  so we were turned out of the court  i told my companions that the question of ibnabikabsha   the prophet muhammad  has become so prominent that even the king of bani alasfar  byzantine  is afraid of him  then i started to become sure that he  the prophet  would be the conqueror in the near future till i embraced islam  ie  allah guided me to it    the sub narrator adds   ibn annatur was the governor of llya   jerusalem  and heraclius was the head of the christians of sham  ibn annatur narrates that once while heraclius was visiting ilya   jerusalem   he got up in the morning with a sad mood  some of his priests asked him why he was in that mood  heraclius was a foreteller and an astrologer  he replied  at night when i looked at the stars  i saw that the leader of those who practice circumcision had appeared  become the conqueror   who are they who practice circumcision   the people replied  except the jews nobody practices circumcision  so you should not be afraid of them  jews   just issue orders to kill every jew present in the country   while they were discussing it  a messenger sent by the king of ghassan to convey the news of allah s apostle to heraclius was brought in  having heard the news  he  heraclius  ordered the people to go and see whether the messenger of ghassan was circumcised  the people  after seeing him  told heraclius that he was circumcised  heraclius then asked him about the arabs  the messenger replied  arabs also practice circumcision    after hearing that  heraclius remarked that sovereignty of the arabs had appeared  heraclius then wrote a letter to his friend in rome who was as good as heraclius in knowledge  heraclius then left for homs   a town in syrian and stayed there till he received the reply of his letter from his friend who agreed with him in his opinion about the emergence of the prophet and the fact that he was a prophet  on that heraclius invited all the heads of the byzantines to assemble in his palace at homs  when they assembled  he ordered that all the doors of his palace be closed  then he came out and said   o byzantines  if success is your desire and if you seek right guidance and want your empire to remain then give a pledge of allegiance to this prophet  ie  embrace islam     on hearing the views of heraclius  the people ran towards the gates of the palace like onagers but found the doors closed  heraclius realized their hatred towards islam and when he lost the hope of their embracing islam  he ordered that they should be brought back in audience   when they returned  he said  what already said was just to test the strength of your conviction and i have seen it   the people prostrated before him and became pleased with him  and this was the end of heraclius s story  in connection with his faith  ,sufyan harb informed heraclius sent messenger

The first      prayer which he offered facing the Ka'ba was the 'Asr prayer in the      company of some people. Then one of those who had offered that prayer      with him came out and passed by some people in a mosque who were      bowing during their prayers (facing Jerusalem).

Hearing that, those people changed their      direction towards the Ka'ba immediately. Jews and the people of the      scriptures used to be pleased to see the Prophet facing Jerusalem in      prayers but when he changed his direction towards the Ka'ba, during      the prayers, they disapproved of it.

121,63,122, Sahih Bukhari ,3,122,Knowledge," Narrated Sa`id bin Jubair:                     I said to Ibn `Abbas, ""Nauf-Al-Bakali claims that Moses (the companion of Khadir) was not the Moses of Bani Israel but he was another Moses."" Ibn `Abbas remarked that the enemy of Allah (Nauf) was a liar.Narrated Ubai bin Ka`b:The Prophet said, ""Once the Prophet Moses stood up and addressed Bani Israel. He was asked, ""Who is the most learned man amongst the people. He said, ""I am the most learned."" Allah admonished Moses as he did not attribute absolute knowledge to Him (Allah). So Allah inspired to him ""At the junction of the two seas there is a slave amongst my slaves who is more learned than you."" Moses said, ""O my Lord! How can I meet him?"" Allah said: Take a fish in a large basket (and proceed) and you will find him at the place where you will lose the fish. So Moses set out along with his (servant) boy, Yusha` bin Noon and carried a fish in a large basket till they reached a rock, where they laid their heads (i.e. lay down) and slept. The fish came out of the basket and it took its way into the sea as in a tunnel. So it was an amazing thing for both Moses and his (servant) boy. They proceeded for the rest of that night and the following day. When the day broke, Moses said to his (servant) boy: ""Bring us our early meal. No doubt, we have suffered much fatigue in this journey."" Moses did not get tired till he passed the place about which he was told. There the (servant) boy told Moses, ""Do you remember when we betook ourselves to the rock, I indeed forgot the fish."" Moses remarked, ""That is what we have been seeking. So they went back retracing their footsteps, till they reached the rock. There they saw a man covered with a garment (or covering himself with his own garment). Moses greeted him. Al-Khadir replied saying, ""How do people greet each other in your land?"" Moses said, ""I am Moses."" He asked, ""The Moses of Bani Israel?"" Moses replied in the affirmative and added, ""May I follow you so that you teach me of that knowledge which you have been taught."" Al-Khadir replied, ""Verily! You will not be able to remain patient with me, O Moses! I have some of the knowledge of Allah which He has taught me and which you do not know, while you have some knowledge which Allah has taught you which I do not know."" Moses said, ""Allah willing, you will find me patient and I will disobey no order of yours. So both of them set out walking along the seashore, as they did not have a boat. In the meantime a boat passed by them and they requested the crew of the boat to take them on board. The crew recognized Al-Khadir and took them on board without fare. Then a sparrow came and stood on the edge of the boat and dipped its beak once or twice in the sea. Al-Khadir said: ""O Moses! My knowledge and your knowledge have not decreased Allah's knowledge except as much as this sparrow has decreased the water of the sea with its beak."" Al- Khadir went to one of the planks of the boat and plucked it out. Moses said, ""These people gave us a free lift but you have broken their boat and scuttled it so as to drown its people."" Al-Khadir replied, ""Didn't I tell you that you will not be able to remain patient with me."" Moses said, ""Call me not to account for what I forgot."" The first (excuse) of Moses was that he had forgotten. Then they proceeded further and found a boy playing with other boys. Al-Khadir took hold of the boy's head from the top and plucked it out with his hands (i.e. killed him). Moses said, ""Have you killed an innocent soul who has killed none."" Al-Khadir replied, ""Did I not tell you that you cannot remain patient with me?"" Then they both proceeded till when they came to the people of a town, they asked them for food, but they refused to entertain them. Then they found there a wall on the point of collapsing. Al-Khadir repaired it with his own hands. Moses said, ""If you had wished, surely you could have taken wages for it."" Al-Khadir replied, ""This is the parting between you and me."" The Prophet added, ""May Allah be Merciful to Moses! Would that he could have been more patient to learn more about his story with Al-Khadir.

124,66,125, Sahih Bukhari ,3,125,Knowledge," Narrated `Abdullah:                     While I was going with the Prophet through the ruins of Medina and he was reclining on a date-palm leaf stalk, some Jews passed by. Some of them said to the others: Ask him (the Prophet) about the spirit. Some of them said that they should not ask him that question as he might give a reply which would displease them. But some of them insisted on asking, and so one of them stood up and asked, ""O Abul-Qasim ! What is the spirit?"" The Prophet remained quiet. I thought he was being inspired Divinely.
